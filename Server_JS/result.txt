I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen asked to clarify Porter said,\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won\u2019t be our leaders. It\u2019s out-right embarrassing.

LaPierre said, \u201cThey brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they\u2019d be better off just making me president.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments.

These are the staffers who devised Obama\u2019s internet fund raising campaign which raised in the neighborhood of $200 million so far. That is more then twice the total funds raised by any candidate in history \u2014 and this was all from the internet campaign.\r\n\r\nWhat I learned from this insider was shocking but I guess we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that when it comes to fund raising there simply are no rules that can\u2019t be broken and no ethics that prevail.\r\n\r\nObama\u2019s internet campaign started out innocently enough with basic e-mail networking, lists saved from previous party campaigns and from\r\n\r\nsupporters who visited any of the Obama campaign web sites. Small contributions came in from these sources and the internet campaign staff were more than pleased by the results.\r\n\r\nThen, about two months into the campaign the daily contribution intake multiplied. Where was it coming from? One of the web site security monitors began to notice the bulk of the contributions were clearly coming in from overseas internet service providers and at the rate and frequency of transmission it was clear these donations were \u201cprogrammed\u201d by a very sophisticated user.\r\n\r\nWhile the security people were not able to track most of the sources due to firewalls and other blocking devices put on these contributions they were able to collate the number of contributions that were coming in seemingly from individuals but the funds were from only a few credit card accounts and bank electronic funds transfers. The internet service providers (ISP) they were able to trace were from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other Middle Eastern countries. One of the banks used for fund transfers was also located in Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nAnother concentrated group of donations was traced to a Chinese ISP with a similar pattern of limited credit card charges.\r\n\r\nIt became clear that these donations were very likely coming from sources other than American voters. This was discussed at length within the campaign and the decision was made that none of these donations violated campaign financing laws.\r\n\r\nIt was also decided that it was not the responsibility of the campaign to audit these millions of contributions as to the actual source (specific credit card number or bank transfer account numbers) to insure that none of these internet contributors exceeded the legal maximum donation on a cumulative basis of many small donations. They also found the record keeping was not complete enough to do it anyway.\r\n\r\nThis is a shocking revelation.\r\n\r\nWe have been concerned about the legality of \u201cbundling\u201d contributions after the recent exposure of illegal bundlers but now it appears we may have an even greater problem.\r\n\r\nI guess we should have been somewhat suspicious when the numbers started to come out. We were told (no proof offered) that the Obama internet contributions were from $10.00 to $25.00 or so.\r\n\r\nIf the $200,000,000 is right, and the average contribution was $15.00, that would mean over 13 million individuals made contributions? That would also be 13 million contributions would need to be processed. How did all that happen?\r\n\r\nI believe the Obama campaign\u2019s internet fund raising needs a serious, in depth investigation and audit. It also appears the whole question of internet fund raising needs investigation by the legislature and perhaps new laws to insure it complies not only with the letter of these laws but the spirit as well.","31":"  According to NASA, the biggest earthquake will hit Delhi soon.

According to sources at the Pentagon, including all branches of the armed forces, the Obama Administration may break with a centuries-old tradition.\r\n\r\nA spokesman for General James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, states that the Obama Administration wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to the office of the President, and no longer to the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"The oath to the Constitution is as old as the document itself.\" the spokesman said, \"At no time in American history, not even in the Civil War, did the oath change or the subject of the oath differ. It has always been to the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe back-and-forth between the White House and the Defense Department was expected as President George W. Bush left office. President Obama has already signed orders to close Guantanamo and to pull combat troops from Iraq. But, this, say many at the Defense Department, goes too far.\r\n\r\n\"Technically, we can't talk about it before it becomes official policy.\" the spokesman continued. \"However, the Defense Department, including the Secretary, will not take this laying down. Expect a fight from the bureaucracy and the brass.\"\r\n\r\nSources at the White House had a different point of view. In a circular distributed by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, the rationale for the change was made more clear.\r\n\r\n\"The President feels that the military has been too indoctrinated by the old harbingers of hate: nationalism, racism, and classism. By removing an oath to the American society, the soldiers are less likely to commit atrocities like those at Abu Ghraib.\"\r\n\r\n\"We expect a lot of flak over this,\" the classified memo continues. \"But those that would be most against it are those looking either for attention or control.\"\r\n\r\nThe time frame for the changes are unknown. However, it is more likely that the changes will be made around the July 4th holiday, in order to dampen any potential backlash. The difference in the oath will actually only be slight. The main differences will be the new phrasing. It is expected that the oath to the Constitution will be entirely phased out within two years.","33":"  MILEY CYRUS DEAD AT THE AGE OF 22, Hollywood, CA \u2013  Miley Cyrus\u2019 lifeless body was found by her entourage in a bathtub at her Hollywood home, authorities revealed.

He clutches his head and sits for a moment to catch his breath.\r\n\r\nThe stunned jogger lifts himself up and goes on his way, resuming a brisk jog.\r\n\r\nBut seconds later after around ten yards a second bolt of powerful lightning strikes the man, knocking him to the ground again. Another dark shadow forms on the ground.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the man pulls himself to his feet and struggles away, even if he is a little confused by what just happened.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing video has become an internet sensation with thousands of people expressing their surprise that the unlucky man survived.\r\n\r\nThe chances of being struck by lighting once in a give year are around one in 700,000. The chance of being struck twice within such a short space of time are virtually unmeasurable.\r\n\r\nIt is not known where the video was recorded, although there is Chinese writing in the top corner of the screen.\r\n\r\nCynics suggested that so high was the probability of such a freak accident that the video might have been faked. \r\n\r\nSome internet users pointed to the lack of visible rain in the CCTV footage while one suggested that lightening hitting the ground would have caused the camera to shake.\r\n\r\nAnother stated that in the video the lightning lasted for only one frame, whereas, they said, real lightning would have 'overexposed the camera for at least a few frames on each strike'.\r\n\r\nBut other viewers said the video was genuine.\r\n\r\nOne wrote: 'Security cameras don't just shake every time it's windy don't they? Pause the video when the dude gets hit and look at the light, that's pretty hard to fake, don't you think?'\r\n\r\nAnother added: 'Photoshop can't make a thunder like that. Real.'\r\n\r\nAnd one person wrote: 'I think this is the lesson for all of us - if you are hit by lightning don't get up because you will feel a second wave.'\r\n\r\nOnly around ten per cent of people who are struck by lightning die, usually because the bolt of electricity causes their heart and breathing to stop.\r\n\r\nThose who survive tend to wake up from the shock within a few seconds but have little recollection of what happened before the injury. They could suffer minor burns and stroke-like symptoms. A doctor may later point to lightning strikes as the cause of injury.","35":"  Legendary country music star Willie Nelson was found dead today in his Maui home. He was 81 years old.

Fox Viewers represented 2,650 members of the test group\r\n-----\r\nTest subjects who received their news from other outlets or reported they do not watch the news scored an average IQ of 104, compared to 80 for Fox News viewers. \r\n\r\nLead researcher, P.

This set off a myriad of bells and whistles on our end so we asked our Japanese WWN affiliates to check out the Kuang Ren factory in the Zhejiang province where the beef is packaged. Within hours our Japanese colleagues were back in touch with a shocking discovery, the so called beef is actually cat and dog meat.\r\n\r\nWe all know that that the Chinese have been known to eat cat and dog meat but we never thought that they would have the cajones to import the goods to the US. Taco Bell would not return our phone calls, which leads us to believe that this must be true.\r\n\r\nUpon the discovery of the news, we immediately did the right thing and informed the FDA. The FDA has since mandated that all Taco Bells must be closed forever. So go get as many doggy burritos and kitty fajitas as you can before they are gone for good.","41":"  ROCKLAND \u2014 14-year-old Amanda Peters hid her pregnancy from her mother for nearly three months until she began to show.

Bently spoke with local news station WSFA 12 News about the charges against the boy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI applaud the Alabama District court systems here in Montgomery,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cThis is exactly why I implemented the state law of \u2018Self-Rape\u2019 last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. I plan to do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don\u2019t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\r\n\r\nHorner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the Alabama Southern District Court, broke down in tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.\r\n\r\nTranscripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:\r\n\r\n\u201c911, what\u2019s your emergency?\u201d\r\n\u201cHelp! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in this house and I don\u2019t know what kind of demons possessed him to violate his body in such a matter. I\u2019m so shaken up! Please send help immediately!\u201d\r\n\r\n33-year-old Martha Horner, mother to the young boy, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.\r\n\r\n\u201cUp until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,\u201d Horner\u2019s mother said. \u201cBut somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil\u2019s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!\u201d\r\n\r\nMs. Horner\u2019s controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.\r\n\r\n\u201cSTOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Martha Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,\u201d Childs told reporters. \u201cShe really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nA mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.\r\n\r\n\u201cFappy\u00ae has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy\u00ae, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great a great man as Governor Bentley, we\u2019re ridding the demons from these heathen\u2019s pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy\u00ae vows to stay on this case until justice is served!\u201d\r\n\r\nOfficer Tom Downey with the Montgomery Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Montgomery Fox News station WVOC about the arrest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his \u2018girl on girl action\u2019, as he said it, makes me sick! It\u2019s a slippery slope my friend, one day it\u2019s masturbating to porn, the next day it\u2019s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.\u201d Downey continued, \u201cThere is no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that I tell ya. I know I can sleep better at night just knowing another criminal is off the streets.\u201d\r\n\r\nDetectives confiscated pornography and lube found in the teenager\u2019s room as evidence.\r\n\r\nProsecutors told local reporters that based on the severity of the crime, the new Alabama state law of Self-Rape A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 34-171 & 52-69 would carry a minimum of 3 years with a maximum of 15 years depending on that criminals past history.\r\n\r\nHorner is currently being held at the Montgomery County Jail. He presently has no bond set and the judge has restricted him from seeing visitors. Horner\u2019s next scheduled court appearance is May 3rd.\r\n\r\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach both children and adults about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.

A year and a half after the series finale, in which Cranston played cancer riddled Walter White, doctors have attributed Cranston\u2019s career\u2019s sickness to his minor role in 2014\u2019s reboot of the Godzilla franchise.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a known carcinogen,\u201d said famed oncologist Dr Hugh Hormones. \u201cTaking small parts in disappointing remakes of classic movies is a surefire way to precipitate the disease. We warn actors time and time again, but after starring in long-running award-winning series, the temptation of getting back out there is just too great.\u201d\r\n\r\nFans of the actor have come out in huge support of his ailing career, sending sympathetic tweets and reposting photos they had taken with him \u2013 most of them show the man with a still-healthy looking career.\r\n\r\n\u201cBreaking Bad was always gonna be impossible to top,\u201d tweeted TheRealJohnJonson. \u201c#WeLoveYouWalterWhite\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBryan Cranston will forever be Walter White in my heart,\u201d posted JessePinkmanStillLives. \u201c#IBoughtGodzillaOnBluRay #ItWasOnSale #SupportCranston\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that Cranston may not the only member of the cast of the AMC hit to be stricken with this rampant disease. Co-star Aaron Paul is said to be undergoing tests after symptoms that his own career might be deteriorating due to the incurable illness.\r\n\r\n\u201cAaron took few precautions in exposed himself to an even more severe carcinogen,\u201d said Dr Hormones, referring to Paul\u2019s part in the latest reimagining of the story of Moses, Exodus: Gods and Kings. In it, Paul takes the role of Joshua, whose only lines include shouting the name \u201cMoses\u201d unclearly. This comes hot on the heels of his action film Need For Speed, a film about fast cars that is, curiously, not based on the video game series of the same name, and is a movie that most people aren\u2019t even aware exists.\r\n\r\nFamily members of both victims have announced that they will stand by their loved ones\u2019 sides throughout, and will \u201cfight this thing together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAaron and Bryan at least have each other to get through it with. Their careers have for so long been interlinked, and now they will until the end,\u201d said a family friend of Cranston\u2019s.\r\n\r\nReports, however, suggest that Paul may be exposing himself to yet another possibly fatal carcinogen, with rumors placing him in the role of the scarecrow in an as yet unannounced reboot of the Hollywood classic The Wizard of Oz.","45":"  I have spent several days lecturing at the WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL CONFERENCE on \u201cASPARTAME marketed as \u2018NutraSweet\u2019, \u2018Equal\u2019, and \u2018Spoonful\u201d\u2018. In the keynote address by the EPA, they announced that there was an epidemic of multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus, and they did not understand what toxin was causing this to be rampant across the United States. I explained that I was there to lecture on exactly that subject.\r\n\r\nWhen the temperature of Aspartame exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood alcohol ASPARTAME coverts to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which in turn causes metabolic acidosis. (Formic acid is the poison found in the sting of fire ants). The methanol toxicity mimics multiple sclerosis; thus people are being diagnosed with having multiple sclerosis in error. The multiple sclerosis is not a death sentence, where methanol toxicity is.\r\n\r\nIn the case of systemic lupus, we are finding it has become almost as rampant as multiple sclerosis, especially Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi drinkers. Also, with methanol toxicity, the victims usually drink three to four 12 oz. cans of them per day, some even more. In the cases of systemic lupus, which is triggered by ASPARTAME, the victim usually does not know that the aspartame is the culprit. The victim continues its use aggravating the lupus to such a degree, that sometimes it becomes life threatening.\r\n\r\nWhen we get people off the aspartame, those with systemic lupus usually become asymptomatic. Unfortunately, we can not reverse this disease. On the other hand, in the case of those diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, (when in reality, the disease is methanol toxicity), most of the symptoms disappear. We have seen cases where their vision has returned and even their hearing has returned. This also applies to cases of tinnitus. During a lecture I said \u201cIf you are using ASPARTAME (NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, etc.) and you suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms, spasms, shooting pains, numbness in your legs, cramps, vertigo, dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, joint pain, depression, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory loss \u2014 you probably have ASPARTAME DISEASE!\u201d\r\n\r\nPeople were jumping up during the lecture saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got this, is it reversible?\u201d It is rampant. Some of the speakers at my lecture even were suffering from these symptoms. In one lecture attended by the Ambassador of Uganda, he told us that their sugar industry is adding aspartame! He continued by saying that one of the industry leader\u2019s son could no longer walk \u2013 due in part by product usage!\r\n\r\nWe have a very serious problem. Even a stranger came up to Dr. Espisto (one of my speakers) and myself and said, \u2018Could you tell me why so many people seem to be coming down with MS? During a visit to a hospice, a nurse said that six of her friends, who were heavy Diet Coke addicts, had all been diagnosed with MS. This is beyond coincidence.\r\n\r\nHere is the problem. There were Congressional Hearings when aspartame was included in 100 different products. Since this initial hearing, there\r\nhave been two subsequent hearings, but to no avail. Nothing as been done. The drug and chemical lobbies have very deep pockets. Now there are over\r\n5,000 products containing this chemical, and the PATENT HAS EXPIRED!!!!!\r\n\r\nAt the time of this first hearing, people were going blind. The methanol in the aspartame converts to formaldehyde in the retina of the eye. Formaldehyde is grouped in the same class of drugs as cyanide and arsenic DEADLY POISONS!!! Unfortunately, it just takes longer to quietly kill, but it is killing people and causing all kinds of neurological problems. Aspartame changes the brain\u2019s chemistry. It is the reason for severe seizures. This drug changes the dopamine level in the brain. Imagine what this drug does to patients suffering from Parkinson\u2019s Disease. This drug also causes Birth Defects.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no reason to take this product. It is NOT A DIET PRODUCT!!! The Congressional record said, \u201cIt makes you crave carbohydrates and will make you FAT\u201d. Dr. Roberts stated that when he got patients off aspartame, their average weight loss was 19 pounds per person. The formaldehyde stores in the fat cells, particularly in the hips and thighs.\r\n\r\nAspartame is especially deadly for diabetics. All physicians know what wood alcohol will do to a diabetic. We find that physicians believe that they have patients with retinopathy, when in fact, it is caused by the aspartame. The aspartame keeps the blood sugar level out of control, causing many patients to go into a coma. Unfortunately, many have died. People were telling us at the Conference of the American College of Physicians, that they had relatives that switched from saccharin to an aspartame product and how that relative had eventually gone into a coma. Their physicians could not get the blood sugar levels under control. Thus, the patients suffered acute memory loss and eventually coma and death.\r\n\r\nMemory loss is due to the fact that aspartic acid and phenylalanine are neurotoxic without the other amino acids found in protein. Thus it goes past the blood brain barrier and deteriorates the neurons of the brain. Dr. Russell Blaylock, neurosurgeon, said, \u201cThe ingredients stimulates the neurons of the brain to death, causing brain damage of varying degrees. Dr. Blaylock has written a book entitled EXCITOTOXINS: THE TASTE THAT KILLS\u201d (Health Press 1-800-643-2665). Dr. H.J. Roberts, diabetic specialist and world expert on aspartame poisoning, has also written a book entitled DEFENSE AGAINST ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE\u201d (1-800-814-9800). Dr. Roberts tells how aspartame poisoning is escalating Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, and indeed it is. As the hospice nurse told me, women are being admitted at 30 years of age with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Dr. Blaylock and Dr. Roberts will be writing a position paper with some case histories and will post it on the Internet.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Conference of the American College of Physicians, \u2018We are talking about a plague of neurological diseases caused by this deadly poison\u201d.\r\n\r\nDr. Roberts realized what was happening when aspartame was first marketed. He said \u201chis diabetic patients presented memory loss, confusion, and severe vision loss\u201d. At the Conference of the American College of Physicians, doctors admitted that they did not know. They had wondered why seizures were rampant (the phenylalanine in aspartame breaks down the seizure threshold and depletes serotonin, which causes manic depression, panic attacks, rage and violence).\r\n\r\nJust before the Conference, I received a FAX from Norway, asking for a possible antidote for this poison because they are experiencing so many problems in their country. This poison is now available in 90 PLUS countries worldwide. Fortunately, we had speakers and ambassadors at the Conference from different nations who have pledged their help. We ask that you help too. Print this article out and warn everyone you know. Take anything that contains aspartame back to the store. Take the \u201cNO ASPARTAME TEST\u201d and send us your case history.","46":"  While they were exploring the galleries, they stumbled upon Cheung Wai, a 59-year-old survivor from the 2001 accident, obviously in a rather bad shape.\n\nWai was immediately taken to the hospital where a complete evaluation of his physical and mental states will be done over the next weeks.\n\nThe poor man had remained trapped underground with the bodies of 78 of his dead coworkers after an earthquake of a magnitude of 7,8 hit the region and caused the wooden support structure of the mine to crumble and collapse.\n\nSomehow lucky in his misfortune, Mr. Cheung was saved by the fact that a ventilation duct still connected his underground prison to the surface, allowing him access to air that was sufficiently pure to keep him alive.\nWai managed to survive thanks to an emergency stash of rice and water, stored in an underground depot, conceived especially for this kind of case.\n\nThe man complemented his diet by catching and eating the countless rats that pullulate in the mine, as well as collecting large quantities of some sort of phosphorescent moss, which constituted his only source of vitamins. \nEven though Wai was suffering from great physical and mental stress, he managed to give proper burials to all of his comrades, spending almost a year in this great selfless act.\n\nMining accidents remain common in China, despite growing measures by the government to reduce the problem, which killed more than 4000 miners a year at the beginning of the millennium.\n\nOver the last years, the authorities have been cracking down on many unregulated mining operations which account for almost 80 percent of the country\u2019s 16,000 mines.\n\nThe closure of about 1,000 dangerous small mines last year helped to cut in half the average number of miners killed, to about six a day, in the first months of this year, according to government statistics.\n\nThe case of Mr. Cheung remains unique, however, and constitutes a world record, according to the universally recognized authority on record-breaking achievement, Guinness.\nThe former record for surviving underground was of 142 days and was held by a British man named Geoff Smith. He had been voluntarily buried in the backyard of the Railway Inn, his favorite pub, with the intention of breaking the record.","47":"  Suez | Egypt\u2019s Antiquities Ministry announced this morning that a team of underwater archaeologists had discovered that remains of a large Egyptian army from the 14th century BC, at the bottom of the Gulf of Suez, 1.5 kilometers offshore from the modern city of  Ras Gharib.\nThe team was searching for the remains of ancient ships and artifacts related to Stone Age and Bronze Age trade in the Red Sea area when they stumbled upon a gigantic mass of human bones darkened by age.\n\nThe scientists led by Professor Abdel Muhammad Gader and associated with Cairo University\u2019s Faculty of Archaeology, have already recovered a total of more than 400 different skeletons, as well as hundreds of weapons and pieces of armor.\n\nThe remains of two war chariots were also discovered scattered over an area of approximately 200 square meters.\n\nThey estimate that more than 5,000 other bodies could be dispersed over a wider area, suggesting that an army of large size may have perished on the site.\n\nThis magnificient blade from an egyptian khopesh, was certainly the weapon of an important character. It was discovered near the remains of a highly decorated war chariot, suggesting it could have belonged to a prince or nobleman.\nMany clues on the site have brought Professor Gader and his team to conclude that the bodies could be linked to the famous episode of the Exodus.\n\nFirst of all, the ancient soldiers seem to have died on dry ground, since no traces of boats or ships have been found in the area.\n\nThe positions of the bodies and the fact that they were stuck in a vast quantity of clay and rock imply that they could have died in a mudslide or a tidal wave.\nThe sheer number of bodies suggests that a large ancient army perished on the site, and the dramatic way by which they were killed, seem to corroborate the biblical version of the Red Sea Crossing when the army of the Egyptian Pharaoh was destroyed by the returning waters that Moses had parted.\n\nThis new find certainly proves that there was indeed an Egyptian army of large size that was destroyed by the waters of the Red Sea during the reign of King Akhenaten.\n\nThe famous biblical account of the \"Red Sea Crossing\" was dismisseded by many scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical.\nFor centuries, the famous biblical account of the \u201cRed Sea Crossing\u201d was dismissed by most scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical.\n\n\u201cThis astounding discovery brings undeniable scientific proof that one the most famous episodes of the Old Testament was indeed based on a historical event,\u201d Professor Gader said during the press conference.\n\u201cIt brings a brand new perspective on a story that many historians have been considering for years as a work of fiction and suggesting that other biblical stories like the Plagues of Egypt could indeed have a historical base.\n\nA lot more research and many more recovery operations are to be expected on the site over the next few years, as Professor Gader and his team have already announced their desire to retrieve the rest of the bodies and artefacts from was has turned out to be one of the richest archaeological underwater sites ever discovered.","48":"  I was opening up my almost brand new Dell 600m laptop, to replace a broken PCMCIA slot riser on the motherboard. As soon as I got the keyboard off, I noticed a small cable running from the keyboard connection underneath a piece of metal protecting the motherboard.\r\nI figured \u201cNo Big Deal\u201d, and continued with the dissasembly. But when I got the metal panels off, I saw a small white heatshink-wrapped package. Being ever-curious, I sliced the heatshrink open. I found a little circuit board inside. Being an EE by trade, this piqued my curiosity considerably. On one side of the board, one Atmel AT45D041A four megabit Flash memory chip. On the other side, one Microchip Technology PIC16F876 Programmable Interrupt Controller, along with a little Fairchild Semiconductor CD4066BCM quad bilateral switch.\r\n\r\nLooking further, I saw that the other end of the cable was connected to the integrated ethernet board.\r\n\r\nWhat could this mean? I called Dell tech support about it, and they said, and I quote, \u201cThe intregrated service tag identifier is there for assisting customers in the event of lost or misplaced personal information.\u201d He then hung up. A little more research, and I found that that board spliced in between the keyboard and the ethernet chip is little more than a Keyghost hardware keylogger.","49":"  The shocking minutes relating to President Putin\u2019s meeting this past week with US Secretary of State John Kerry reveal the Russian leaders \u201cextreme outrage\u201d over the Obama regimes continued protection of global seed and plant bio-genetic giants Syngenta and Monsanto in the face of a growing \u201cbee apocalypse\u201d that the Kremlin warns \u201cwill most certainly\u201d lead to world war.\r\nAccording to these minutes, released in the Kremlin today by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (MNRE), Putin was so incensed over the Obama regime\u2019s refusal to discuss this grave matter that he refused for three hours to even meet with Kerry, who had traveled to Moscow on a scheduled diplomatic mission, but then relented so as to not cause an even greater rift between these two nations.The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RS) today has issued an \u201cExtreme Danger\u201d warning for all vessels entering or nearing the United States Port of Mobile, located in the State of Alabama, as the death toll rises from what this report claims is an environmental disaster related to the flowering of genetically modified cotton crops located in this region.\r\nAccording to this report, RS officials became \u201chighly concerned\u201d this past week after the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) reported that at least 2 people have died, and another 5 put in hospital, due to a \u201cmysterious illness\u201d attacking the respiratory systems of those affected and causing flu-like symptoms."}}
